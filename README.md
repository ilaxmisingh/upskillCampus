Project 1: Crop and Weed Detection Using Machine Learning
This project involves building a Crop and Weed Detection System using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to classify images of crops and weeds, which is useful in precision agriculture for automating the process of weed control.

Project 2: Predictive Maintenance for Gearbox Fault Diagnosis
This project aims to implement Predictive Maintenance for gearboxes using vibration sensor data. By analyzing vibration patterns, the system can predict faults in gearboxes, enabling timely maintenance and reducing downtime in industrial operations.

Both these projects are undertaken as part of the UPSKILLS CAMPUS Internship program. This program provides an opportunity to work on real-world applications, where machine learning techniques are applied to solve problems in agriculture (Crop and Weed Detection) and industrial automation (Predictive Maintenance for machinery). The projects are designed to enhance skills in data science and machine learning, making the internship a valuable learning experience.
